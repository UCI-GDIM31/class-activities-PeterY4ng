Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

r, g, and b are float variables because they represent decimal values for colors, so they can't be integers, booleans, or strings. The _bounces variable is an integer because the number of times a ball bounces can only be a whole number, not a decimal, boolean, or string. The error I encountered in Step 4 of Part 2 was "Assets\W2\Scripts\Ball.cs(67,18): error CS1002: ; expected", which means I didn't add a ";" at the end of that line of code, making it incomplete.
